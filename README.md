Overview
This project is a Recipe Recommendation System that integrates machine learning inference and multiple APIs to detect ingredients from uploaded images and provide recipe suggestions. It also offers an analysis feature that evaluates recipe suitability based on user-specific data.

Features
1. Ingredient Detection
Uses the Roboflow Inference API to detect ingredients in uploaded images.

2. Recipe Recommendation
Fetches recipes based on detected ingredients using the Spoonacular API.

3. Recipe Analysis
Allows users to input personal details (e.g., weight, height, and health conditions) and analyzes recipe suitability using JamAI.

4. Dynamic Redirection
Redirects users to detailed recipe pages on Spoonacular.

Limitation
The application faces limitations due to API rate limits, which restrict the number of requests that can be made within a specific timeframe. This can result in failed operations, particularly during periods of high user activity.

The system's functionality is heavily dependent on the availability of external APIs, meaning any downtime or outages from the API providers will directly impact the application's performance.

The Spoonacular API relies on pre-existing recipe data, which may not include the latest or trending recipes. This limitation reduces the application's ability to provide fresh or unique content to users.

Dependencies
Python Libraries:
os
requests
flask
tempfile
re
External SDKs: inference_sdk, jamaibase
APIs and Services:
Roboflow Inference API: For object detection in images.
Spoonacular API: For recipe retrieval.
JamAI: For advanced analysis and result storage.
File Structure
app.py: Main application file containing the Flask app and routes.
templates/: Directory for HTML templates.
index.html: Home page for image uploads.
recipes.html: Displays detected ingredients and recommended recipes.
analysis_result.html: Shows analyzed recipe suitability.
static/: Directory for static files (CSS, JS, images).
Usage
Install Dependencies Use the following command to install required Python libraries:

pip install flask requests
Run the Application
Start the Flask application:

python app.py
By default, the app runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Upload an Image

Navigate to the home page.
Upload an image of food items.
View detected ingredients and recipes.
Analyze Recipe

Input your weight, height, and health conditions.
Get a detailed analysis of the recipe's suitability.
API Configuration
Roboflow API

Replace api_url and api_key in InferenceHTTPClient initialization with your Roboflow credentials.
Spoonacular API

Replace SPOONACULAR_API_KEY with your Spoonacular API key.
JamAI API

Replace the api_key and project_id in JamAI initialization with your JamAI credentials.
Code Highlights
Ingredient Detection (Roboflow)
result = CLIENT.infer(temp_file.name, model_id=MODEL_ID)
for prediction in result["predictions"]:
    label = prediction["class"]
    detected_items.append(label)
Recipe Fetching (Spoonacular)
params = {
    "apiKey": SPOONACULAR_API_KEY,
    "query": ",".join(detected_items),
    "number": 20,
    "ranking": 2
}
response = requests.get(SPOONACULAR_API_URL, params=params)
Analysis (JamAI)
completion = jamai.add_table_rows(
    "action",
    p.RowAddRequest(
        table_id="Recipe",
        data=[{"weight": weight, "height": height, "diseases": diseases, "summary": recipe_summary}]
    )
)
